Generates data for find-releases at https://storage.googleapis.com/chromium-find-releases-static/.

Current approach is to pull tags, git-rev list everything, and then git
name-rev without branch-heads, and keep a cache. remotes/origin/HEAD, lkcr,
etc. are not stored in the cache so that when new tags are made, commits are
attributed to the correct release.

gen_static then generates a set of of partitioned html files by the first three
digits of the commit prefix, which can be redirected to as /aaa.html#aaa2345...


Setup notes for self:
When setting up a new machine to run cron:
- follow directory creation/locations in update script
- git branch -d master after fetch chromium
- gcloud init to auth to storage bucket
- get client_id.json as mail.py wants
- crontab -e wants:
*/10 * * * * /path/to/update-and-mail-on-failure
